The primary aim of this study was to increase the mean time spent within the target SpO2 range (WTR) by 10% and to reduce the frequencyof desaturation events by 5 events per patient day, respectively, within 18 months of implementing a care bundle. Methods: Thisstudy was completed in a 46-bed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), involving 246 staff members and led by a quality improvementteam. The change interventions included implementing new practice guidelines, reviewing daily summaries of SpO2 maintenance,daily infant wellness assessment, standardizing workflow, and responding to SpO2 alarms. In addition, we collected staff satisfaction and compliance with change interventions, resource use, and morbidity and mortality data at discharge. Results: The meantime spent WTR increased from 65.3% to 75.3%, and the frequency of desaturation events decreased from 25.1 to 16.5 eventsper patient day, respectively, with a higher magnitude of benefit in infants on days with supplemental oxygen. Postimplementation,the duration of high-frequency ventilation and supplemental oxygen were lower, but morbidity and mortality rates were similar. Staffsatisfaction with training workshops, coaching, use of the infant wellness assessment tool, and SpO2 alarm management algorithmswere 74%, 82%, 80%, and 74%, respectively. Conclusion: Implementing a care bundle to improve oxygen maintenance andreduce desaturation events increased the time spent WTR and reduced the frequency of desaturation events.

Care Bundle to Improve Oxygen Maintenance and Reduce DesaturationEvents: A Single Center QI Study. Pediatr Qual Saf 2023;00:e639.Received for publication December 17, 2021; Accepted February 14, 2023.Published online March 13, 2023DOI: 10.1097/pq9.0000000000000639Individual QI projects from single institutionsCare Bundle to Improve Oxygen Maintenance and Events2Pediatric Quality and Safety46% of the time, and individual patients experienced 43desaturation events daily. In contrast, other NICUs reportmaintenance of SpO2 within the target range 60%&ndash;66%of the time.9&ndash;13A survey of McMaster NICU providers identifiedpotential contributory factors, including incorrect alarmlimit settings, inconsistent use of SpO2 event review features of the monitors, and lack of standardization of theresponses to SpO2 alarms. Thus, our NICU had a significant opportunity for improvement.In January 2014, we launched a quality improvement(QI) project in infants younger than 32 weeks gestation(1) to increase the mean SpO2 time spent WTR by 10%and (2) to reduce the frequency of desaturations by 5events per patient day from baseline within 18 months.The secondary goals were to assess resource utilizationand the discharge morbidity and mortality.METHODSSettingWe conducted this study in a 46-bed NICU with approximately 200 annual inborn and outborn admissions ofinfants younger than 32 weeks gestation and an averagedaily census of 43. We measure SpO2 using a Masimo SETRadical pulse oximeter (software version 46.02; MasimoRadical, Masimo Corporation) integrated into the bedside Intellivue monitor (Philips Healthcare Nederland).Baseline Process of SpO2 Maintenance and EventManagementPreintervention, the prescribed SpO2 alarm targets were84%&ndash;93% for infants receiving supplemental oxygen and84%&ndash;100% for infants not on oxygen supplementation. Inaddition, clinical teams did not routinely review SpO2 histograms and daily event review reports during bedside rounds.Thus, decisions about escalation or deescalation of oxygentherapy were subjective and primarily reflected the staff&rsquo;s perception of oxygen requirements over the preceding 4&ndash;8 hours.QI ProjectOur QI team included 2 physicians (MD), a nurse practitioner, a nurse educator, a respiratory therapy (RT) educator, an RT practice leader, a biomedical engineer, and aproject facilitator. The team developed a project charter,deconstructed the problem using a cause-and-effect diagram (Fig. 1), and created a key driver diagram (Fig. 2).Interventions included new practice guidelines, reviewing daily summaries of SpO2 maintenance, daily infantwellness assessment, standardized workflow, and staff&rsquo;sresponse to SpO2 alarms. Ten neonatologists, 20 fellows, 12 nurse practitioners, 160 nurses (registered nurse[RN]), 32 RTs, and 12 allied staff members participatedin this study.Study subjects included all infants admitted at youngerthan 32 weeks gestation but excluded infants withcyanotic congenital heart disease and other major congenital malformations. We monitored SpO2 and desaturation events from admission until discharge or until theinfant breathed spontaneously without respiratory support or supplemental oxygen for more than 72 hours. Weanalyzed the data in 3 phases to simplify the schedulingof facilitators and the QI team members. These phaseswere preimplementation (May 12&ndash;November 30, 2014),implementation (December 1, 2014, to May 31, 2015),and postimplementation (June 1&ndash;December 31, 2015).Design and Testing of Changes to Improve SpO2Targeting and Manage EventsWe hypothesized that effective implementation of evidence-based practices and technology integration wouldresult in more time spent WTR with fewer desaturationevents. A literature review identified appropriate SpO2targets and alarm limits for preterm infants,15&ndash;17 algorithms to facilitate consistent response to SpO2 alarms,13and strategies for implementation. We captured metricsrelevant to the project by a daily review of the SpO2histogram, event frequency, triggers for escalation, andweaning of care practices. These metrics were documented and tracked using a customized tool created forthis project called the Review of Oxygen Saturation andEvents (ROSE) tool (Fig. 3). Using this tool, we categorized an infant&rsquo;s status into stable, watcher, and unstablestates.The care bundle to improve oxygenation and minimizedesaturation events (Fig. 2) included:1. unit guidelines specifying SpO2 target and alarmlimits;2. verification that alarm limits on the monitor corresponded to guidelines at the beginning of every shift;3. standardization of staff response to SpO2 alarms(Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content, whichdescribes guideline to standardize response to eventsby point of care staff, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A464);4. reporting during daily rounds the percentage timespent within and outside the target SpO2 rangeand frequency of desaturations over the preceding24-hour period (Figure 2, Supplemental DigitalContent, which describes process map showingworkflow changes and integration of CBIOME interventions into NICU daily routine and standard work,http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A465);5. placement of printed SpO2 histogram and eventreview reports at the bedside6. staff coaching to help them identify improvementsor deteriorations based on daily SpO2 histogram andevent review reports and appreciate the real-timeimpact of their care;7. use of cognitive aids18 to determine underlyingetiology for desaturation events and to choose corrective actions from a menu of interventions (Table1, Supplemental Digital Content, which describes Shivananda et al &bull; Pediatric Quality and Safety (2023) 8:2;e639 www.pqs.com3cognitive aid determining underlying etiology offrequent events or difficulty in oxygen saturationmaintenance within desired SpO2 target range andpotentially beneficial supportive care practices toimprove infant&rsquo;s stability, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A467), and8. systematic escalation or deescalation of care basedon infant status.ImplementationAll bedside monitors were configured to detect SpO2data with a 20-second averaging time. We set alarmFig. 1. Cause-and-effect diagram. Understanding the challenges of SpO2 maintenance and frequent desaturations. O2 indicatesoxygen; SpO2, saturation of oxygen.Fig. 2. Key driver diagram to improve oxygen saturation maintenance and reduce desaturation events.Care Bundle to Improve Oxygen Maintenance and Events4Pediatric Quality and Safetylimit triggers for high and low SpO2 with a delay of20 seconds and a 10-second delay for desaturation of80 or lower. In addition, we set event capture triggersfor a SpO2 less than 80 for 10 seconds, bradycardia ofless than 80 per minute of any duration, and apnea ofgreater than 20 seconds.16,19 The monitors calculated theSpO2 histogram over 24 hours with a 1-second real-timesampling rate.The QI team communicated changes via several formats (email, newsletter, and pocket cards) and forums(education days, professional group meetings, and seminars). All staff received training on setting appropriate SpO2 targets and alarm limits, responding to SpO2alarms, and using the ROSE tool in a simulation-basedinterprofessional workshop, followed by bedside coaching (Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content, whichdescribes NICU Team Workshop - CBIOME FacilitatorAgenda, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A468). We introduced interventions (Fig. &nbsp;2) 1&ndash;5 in the first week ofDecember 2014, interventions 6 and 8 in February2015, and intervention 7 (Table 1, SupplementalDigital Content, which describes cognitive aid determining underlying etiology of frequent events or difficulty in oxygen saturation maintenance within desiredSpO2 target range and potentially beneficial supportivecare practices to improve infant&rsquo;s stability, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A467) in August 2015. Training workshops occurred between September and November2014 (twice a week, half a day), and bedside coachingbetween February and June 2015. In addition, the QIteam met monthly to review and address identified gapsand barriers to adoption.In response to performance degradation in the postimplementation period, the QI team used specificinterventions to enhance the staff&rsquo;s compliance withthe care bundle, such as bedside education, role modeling, defining standard work, and showing the benefitof infant wellness assessment using clinical vignettes.Other guidelines, respiratory and other supportive care practices, and nurse staffing did not changeduring the project. Moreover, the project coordinatordaily reviewed the SpO2 histograms and events captured by the monitors and manually documented project metrics.Study of Interventions, Measures, and OutcomesThe primary outcomes were the proportion of time spentWTR and the frequency of desaturation events. Theseevents occurred with or without bradycardia or apnea,as captured on the bedside monitor event report. Wesummed these measures for all patients and expressedthem as a mean percentage of time spent WTR per patientday and the mean number of desaturation events patientday.The secondary outcome measures were a mean percentage of time spent below and above the target SpO2 range(on supplemental O2 days) per patient day, the morbidityassociated with the inadequacy of oxygen maintenanceand frequency of desaturation (eg, BPD and ROP), mortality, the duration of ventilation, and hospital stay. Wedefined any day an infant received supplemental oxygenbetween 8 and 10 am as an oxygen supplemental day. Wegathered outcomes at discharge from the unit&rsquo;s databaseusing standard definitions.20The process measures observed during rounds were thetarget behaviors of RN, RT, and MDs, adherence to monitoring alarm limits, use of the SpO2 management algorithms, and the percentage of SpO2 time spent WTR.

If an infant fits into the watcher and an unstable category under different wellness assessment elements,label infant wellness as &ldquo;unstable&rdquo;. This tool is for use on days with oxygen supplementation.Shivananda et al &bull; Pediatric Quality and Safety (2023) 8:2;e639 www.pqs.com5QI nurse gathered the latter 2 process metrics in May andJune 2015 by indirectly observing RN and RT responsesto desaturation alarms and the providers&rsquo; presentationsduring rounds, respectively.21The balancing measures were adverse events associated with the care bundle (eg, an event requiring intubation or chest compression secondary to a delayedresponse or seizures) captured from an existing adverseevent reporting system and adjudicated by a quality assurance nurse. Furthermore, we documented thefrequency of the education sessions and staff participation, measured staff satisfaction using validated questionnaires,22 and identified the steps required to sustainchanges.AnalysisWe used data from all patient days to determine the meanpercentage of time spent per patient day within and outside the target SpO2 range and the desaturation frequency.To determine the mean percentage of time spent abovethe target SpO2 range, we used only patient days on oxygen supplementation. We analyzed the change over timeusing p- and u-charts (created using QI Macros for excel2018, KnowWare International, Inc., Denver, CO) byplotting data weekly and identifying special cause variation using standard rules.23,24 We compared infant characteristics and outcomes at discharge during 3 phases ofimplementation. The change in observed target behaviorswas analyzed using the Chi-square or Fischer exact testsand Kruskal-Wallis test (IBM Corp. Released 2020. IBMSPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY:IBM Corp).Ethical ConsiderationThe hospital ethics board deemed this project a QI initiative and exempted the study from full ethics boardreview. The QI team adhered to the hospital&rsquo;s privacypolicy.RESULTSDemographicsDuring the study, we included 329 infants with a median(interquartile range) gestational age and birth weight of28 weeks (26&minus;30) and 1160g (812&minus;1452), respectively.The demographic profile of infants in the 3 phases wassimilar (Table 1). There were 10,453 patient days of SpO2histogram and event report data after excluding 3122patient days of missing data (23%). In addition, therewere 6003 patient days when infants received supplemental oxygen. The NICU bed occupancy rate ranged from86% to 100%, with no difference between the 3 studyphases.Time Spent WTR and Frequency of DesaturationEvents of the Entire Study PopulationThe mean percentage of time spent WTR per patient dayincreased from a baseline of 65.3%&ndash;75.3% (Fig. &nbsp;4A).The mean desaturation frequency decreased from abaseline of 25.1 to 16.5 events per patient day (Fig. 4C).Special cause variation with centerline shifts for the meanpercentage of time spent WTR; (Fig. 4A) and frequencyof desaturation events (Fig. 4C) occurred on 4 occasionsat the beginning of 2014-August 25, 2015-February 9,May 18, and August 17. The mean percentage of timespent below the target SpO2 range (Fig. 4B) decreasedfrom a baseline of 17.7% &nbsp;to &nbsp;13.7%, with centerlineshifts occurring on 2 occasions; December 22, 2014, andMay 25, 2015.Subgroup analysis of infants on supplemental oxygen(Fig. 5A&ndash;D) reveals centerline shifts on 4 occasions forthe mean percentage of time spent WTR and below thetarget SpO2 range (Fig. 5B, C) respectively; 3 occasionsfor frequency of desaturation event (Fig. 5D) and on 1occasion for a mean percentage of time spent above targetSpO2 range (Fig. 5A). On days without supplemental oxygen, we noted centerline shifts on a few occasions (FigureTable 1.

Theduration of high-frequency ventilation, need for intubation and ventilation, use of supplemental oxygen, andantibiotic days per 100 NICU patient days, unadjustedfor covariables, were significantly lower in the postimplementation period (Table &nbsp;2) (Table 2, SupplementalDigital Content, which describes NICU Team Workshop -CBIOME Facilitator Agenda, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A468). There was no difference in morbidity and mortality rate (Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content, whichdescribes infant outcomes at NICU discharge, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A470)Process MeasuresThe frequency of appropriately set alarm limits increasedfrom 80% in the preimplementation phase to 95% in thepostimplementation phase. Bedside printouts were available on all days in the implementation and postimplementation periods, except for 3 weeks in June 2015. Staffused the ROSE tool and discussed findings during roundsin 499 (70%) out of 714 patient day encounters whenassessed in May and June 2015. Two hundred thirty-fourcare providers attended the workshops, 160 received bedside coaching, and 90 attended 9 meetings or sessionson reinforcing practices. Staff compliance with SpO2alarm management algorithms increased from a baselineof 0% (September 2014) to 64% during May and June2015. In addition, the staff (n = 63, 53%) reported &ldquo;satisfied/highly satisfied&rdquo; with training workshops, bedsidecoaching, ROSE tool use, and SpO2 alarm managementalgorithms 74%, 82%, 80%, and 74%, respectively.21Fig. 4.

This overall improvement occurreddespite degradation on 2 occasions. This change was initially due to better compliance with the older guideline&rsquo;swider alarm limits (84%&minus;93%) and later because of atemporary discontinuation of histogram reports to conserve paper at the beginning of the postimplementationperiod (Fig. 4A, C). We successfully integrated a multicomponent care bundle into the routine practices of ourNICU with no negative impact on patient outcomes.Among the multiple interventions, the key interventions that are likely to have led to the observed improvements, based on temporal association (Figs. 4, 5), are theintroduction of guidelines, bedside availability of histogram and event review reports, coaching, and standardized reporting of infant wellness using the ROSE tool. Inaddition, we observed a higher magnitude of improvement on days with supplemental oxygen (Fig. 5; Figure3, Supplemental Digital Content, which describes controlcharts showing the mean percentage of time spent above,within, and below the target SpO2 range and mean frequency of desaturation events per patient on days without oxygen supplementation during the study, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A466). We speculate this becauseFig. 5.

The first was choosing the SpO2 target range forinfants 28&ndash;31 weeks. The published evidence is limited.To maintain uniformity of practice and offer the benefitsof narrow alarm limits, we chose the same SpO2 targetsfor infants born between 28 and 31 weeks as infants ofless than younger than 28 weeks.9,15&ndash;17The second challenge was the staff&rsquo;s dependence onprinted reports. A printed report eased staff workload,provided a physical cue to perform their tasks (ie, plottingand reporting), and made it easier to track improvementin the infant status.25 Thus, we continued the printoutsuntil the end of the project with a plan to automate theROSE tool-based infant wellness categorization and displaying it on bedside monitors in the future.Finally, the staff were skeptical about using the ROSEtool, as it might lead to undertreatment or overtreatment.We addressed this skepticism by educating staff about theROSE tool and emphasizing that it was an aid to, but nota substitute for, their bedside clinical judgment and decision-making about the use of supplemental oxygen andrespiratory care management.How do the results of our study compare with thoseof others? Such a comparison is hampered because otherstudies differed in some aspects of their methodology.There were differences in contexts, definitions (eg, maintenance of oxygen saturation in the target range), inclusioncriteria, and duration of observation. Some aspects of ourdata, specifically the 14% increase in time spent WTR and36% time spent above the SpO2 target range in infants onoxygen supplementation, are comparable to other studiesaimed at improving oxygen maintenance.12,13 However,other studies did not observe a reduction in time spentbelow the SpO2 target range.12,13A worrisome observation in our project in all phaseswas the high percentage of time the SpO2 was above thetarget range (30%&minus;35%) in infants receiving oxygensupplementation during all phases. This finding highlights the challenges and limitations of manual bedsideadjustment of supplemental oxygen by nurses or respiratory therapists. Emerging research suggests that we canmaintain SpO2 in the target range more frequently withautomated closed loop-controlled oxygen administrationthan with human-based systems.26,27Although previous studies describe the frequency ofdesaturation events and their natural progression withpostnatal age,19,28&ndash;30 our study is the first to show theimpact of interventions on the frequency of desaturation(Fig. 5). We did not observe any change in ROP or mortality by choosing a higher SpO2 target range, in contrastto the NeOProM study results.31 However, that study wasbased on randomized controlled trial data and is considered a higher level of evidence than our study. Similarly,our study did not change BPD rates, possibly because thecare bundle did not include many practices associatedwith reducing BPD.32,33 We speculate that standardizedmonitoring of infant stability and early extubation and/or weaning oxygen may have contributed to a reductionin invasive ventilation and supplemental oxygen daysobserved in this study. Our study&rsquo;s novel interventionswere improved communication, staff ownership,34 workflow integration,35 and the use of readily available dailysummaries from monitors with no sophisticated customdata acquisition or analysis. Thus, these interventions aregeneralizable to most neonatal units.This study had several limitations, many of which areinnate limitations of pragmatic QI projects.1. We introduced the first 5 changes simultaneously as acare bundle and not in a stepwise fashion. Therefore,we cannot estimate the magnitude of the impact ofindividual change interventions. In addition, the ROSEtool we used to improve communication and identifychanges in infant wellness is an unvalidated tool.2. Survey responses are subject to response bias.3. Although we monitored for adverse events, we mighthave missed such events that were infrequent orunreported.Table 2.

Inability to rationally subgroup infants according toillness severity resulted in several unexplained unstable points on control charts.5. The lack of resources prevented us from gatheringdata on weekends (23% missing data), and certaindetailed data, such as the depth and duration of eachapnea, bradycardia, desaturation, or rebound hyperoxia events; the frequency of use of the cognitive-aidtool and its utility in escalation or deescalation ofcare.Although in the absence of an experimental studydesign, we cannot be completely certain that the observedchanges resulted from concurrent changes in patientacuity, unit census, nurse staffing ratios, and other carepractices. Nevertheless, we believe that the observed gainsresulted from our change package.CONCLUSIONSImplementing a care bundle intended to improve themanagement of SpO2 in preterm infants is associated withincreased time spent within the desired target SpO2 rangeand decreased frequency of desaturation events. In addition, using care bundles can standardize practices, facilitate technology integration, and enable the staff to adoptnew practices in their daily routine.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank all the QI team members (Middleton K, Rich B,Dilario J, Deb B, Paterson D, Dyck G, Schattauer K, andPogorzelski D) for facilitating training, change management, and data collection.
